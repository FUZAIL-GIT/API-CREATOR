# üî• Node Server Maker

Node Server Maker is a Flutter application that automates the process of creating a Node.js server with MongoDB using Express. With this application, you can create a project with pre-installed packages that automatically opens in VS Code after it's created. You can also write code inside the project for multiple APIs, which means multiple collections with pagination and timestamp features, and create schemas using a user-friendly GUI. Additionally, the application can add authentication for your server, including bearer and basic authentication.

One of the most feature-rich aspects of Node Server Maker is that it can create a whole documentation of your API in OpenAPI automatically. All you need to do is go to the URL and test your APIs.
